## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
- IDE-based fresh analysis of Nocoflo project structure

#### Current Project State
- **Primary Purpose:** Nocoflo is a data exploration and management platform that provides a web-based interface for viewing and editing database tables
- **Current Tech Stack:** Python-based web application with SQLite as default database, using NiceGUI for UI
- **Architecture Style:** Monolithic structure with tight coupling between UI components and business logic
- **Deployment Method:** Single application deployment with configurable database backend

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
- [x] Major Feature Modification
- [x] Technology Stack Upgrade
- [x] Performance/Scalability Improvements
- [x] UI/UX Overhaul

#### Enhancement Description
Transform Nocoflo from a monolithic table viewer into a component-based architecture with a plugin system that supports multiple view types (table, chart, form) and multiple datasources (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).

#### Impact Assessment
- [x] Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Enable extensible view types beyond just table view
- Support multiple datasource types beyond SQLite
- Improve maintainability through component separation
- Enable community contributions through plugin system
- Maintain existing functionality while adding new capabilities

#### Background Context
The current Nocoflo system is tightly coupled with hard-coded table views and SQLite-only datasource support. This limits its usefulness for users who need different view types (charts, forms) or work with different database systems. The refactoring will transform it into a flexible, extensible platform with configurable database support while maintaining all existing functionality.

3. **CR3:** UI/UX must maintain consistency with existing design patterns and user workflows
4. **CR4:** Integration with existing authentication and authorization systems must be preserved

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI
The new component-based architecture will integrate with the existing NiceGUI-based UI by:
- Maintaining the current navigation and layout structure
- Preserving existing user workflows for table viewing and editing
- Adding new UI elements for plugin management and view selection
- Ensuring visual consistency with existing design patterns

### Modified/New Screens and Views
- **Enhanced Table View:** Existing table view enhanced with plugin capabilities
- **Plugin Management Screen:** New admin interface for managing plugins
- **View Selection Interface:** New UI for choosing view types per table
- **Chart View:** New view type for data visualization
- **Form View:** New view type for single-record editing

### UI Consistency Requirements
- All new UI elements must follow existing NiceGUI design patterns
- Navigation structure must remain consistent with current implementation
- Color schemes and typography must match existing application
- User interactions must maintain familiar patterns and feedback mechanisms
- Login page must use the same design template and visual styling as the rest of the application
- Authentication UI components must integrate seamlessly with the existing design system

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack
**Languages:** Python 3.x
**Frameworks:** NiceGUI for UI, SQLite for database
**Database:** SQLite as default with custom metadata tables, configurable for other databases
**Infrastructure:** Single application deployment
**External Dependencies:** Standard Python libraries, no external APIs

### Integration Approach
**Database Integration Strategy:** Extend existing metadata tables to support plugin configurations and view preferences, with SQLite as default but configurable for other databases
**API Integration Strategy:** Maintain existing internal API patterns while adding plugin interfaces
**Frontend Integration Strategy:** Component-based approach within existing NiceGUI framework
**Testing Integration Strategy:** Extend existing testing patterns to include plugin and component testing

### Code Organization and Standards
**File Structure Approach:** Organize into components/, plugins/, and maintain existing pages/ structure
**Naming Conventions:** Follow existing Python naming conventions and project patterns
**Coding Standards:** Maintain existing code style and add plugin development guidelines
**Documentation Standards:** Extend existing documentation to include plugin development guides

### Deployment and Operations
**Build Process Integration:** Maintain existing deployment process with plugin discovery
**Deployment Strategy:** Single application deployment with plugin directory structure
**Monitoring and Logging:** Extend existing logging to include plugin activity
**Configuration Management:** Extend existing configuration to support plugin settings

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
**Technical Risks:** Plugin system complexity may impact performance
**Integration Risks:** Component separation may introduce bugs in existing functionality
**Deployment Risks:** Plugin loading may fail in production environments
**Mitigation Strategies:** Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout, fallback mechanisms for plugin failures
