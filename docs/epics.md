## Conclusion

This epic structure provides a comprehensive roadmap for completing the Nocoflo project. The phased approach ensures that critical functionality is implemented first, with enhancements added incrementally. Each epic builds upon the previous ones, creating a solid foundation for the final system.

The current state analysis shows that significant progress has been made on the basic functionality, but the plugin system and component architecture are the key missing pieces that will enable the full vision outlined in the PRD and architecture documents.
